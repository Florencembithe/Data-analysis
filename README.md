📌 Project Description

This Python script provides a complete, well-documented data analysis workflow for the Iris flower dataset. It is designed to fulfill common data analysis requirements including:

Dataset loading and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and group comparisons

Correlation investigation

Data visualizations and dashboard creation

✅ Features & Tasks Completed
1. 📊 Load & Explore the Dataset

Import the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets

Create a clean DataFrame

Explore structure, data types, and memory usage

Handle missing values (if any)

2. 📈 Basic Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics for all numerical features

Group-wise analysis by species (mean and standard deviation)

Species distribution analysis

Correlation matrix with identification of strong feature relationships

3. 🎨 Data Visualization

Includes 6 powerful plots:

Line Chart – Sepal Length trends over sample index by species

Bar Chart – Average Petal Length by species

Histogram – Distribution of Sepal Width

Scatter Plot – Sepal Length vs Petal Length

Box Plot – Petal Width distribution comparison

Heatmap – Correlation matrix of features

4. 🛡️ Additional Functionalities

Exception handling with meaningful error messages

Styled terminal outputs with symbols (✅, ❌, 📈 etc.)

Professional formatting for insights and results

Bonus summary dashboard at the end of the script
